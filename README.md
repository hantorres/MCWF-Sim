# Modeling qubit-environment dynamics

In this project, I evaluate the time evolution for the Jaynes-Cummings model using both the Monte Carlo Wave Function and Linblad's Master Equation. I also visualize and analyze the effects of dissipation in the context of photon number and atom excitation between both methods. I test the system for cases of strong/weak coupling and high/low dissipation.
